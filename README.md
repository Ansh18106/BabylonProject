I have tried created two types of extrusion

- gradual increament in size

  - this is in main.js file
  - to run this change the src to 'main.js' of script tag in index.js file.

- continuous increment in dimensions

  - this is in main1.js file
  - to run this change the src to 'main1.js' of script tag in index.js file.

Will keep try to make it better.
